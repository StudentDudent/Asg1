            Some heroes' skill rank purple allows those in the same factions as them to receive 
            the same buffs and create combos against other teams. Among the factions, some heroes 
            have explicit mixed factions synergy which means they are versatile 
            and can be used in many different teams.
            <br>
            Other than factions and heroes to look out for, take note of the damage numbers dealt by them too.
            Colours in the skill description and in battle helps to let you know what damage your heroes are dealing.
            In some events or when fighting the elemental hydras, it is important to know which heroes are compatible 
            when dealing a specific type of damage to bring about the most damage dealt.

        <h1>Tips:</h1>
        <div class="rest">
            The stats on skins stack so getting more skins on your heroes could be one of the many ways to increase 
            your Heroes' strength. You can only pick one skin as your Heroes' appearance. Some skins are only available 
            during limited period events. They are not free so you have to put some thought before buying the skins 
            you want. Usually skins can be bought with skin stones you get from defeating bosses in the Outland. 
            Whether from the free chests after each victory or from the skin stone chests at the merchant and after 
            completing daily quests. There are three types: Intelligence, Strength and Agility.

            Rather than keeping count of your gems, be careful with overspending your coins as it is the main currency that 
            the game runs on. As you advance further and get stronger, spending coins will become more expensive 
            and it will be much harder to earn it back unless you are going play the game for long hours.
            Going into bankruptcy in the game also means having to use your gems to spin the coin wheel where it 
            may not be a fair trade for some players. Each spin is 20 gems and ten spins is 200. After the third spin,
            the gems will increase from 20 to 30 per spin. To put it simply, you would have to be gambling back your coins 
            if you wants to upgrade your heroes and titans.
