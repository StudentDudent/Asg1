        <h2>Recent Hero Released</h2>
        <h3>Mushy & Shroom</h3>
        <p>"We are one. We are Legion."
            Concealed in the depth of the Magic Forest,
            the mushroom army kept growing for countless 
            years, until a mysterious threat loomed over 
            the world. The mycelium's collective mind was 
            then forced to reveal itself and join the Guardians of the Dominion, 
            its truly newformed allies. </p>
        <p>Mushy and Shroom are representatives of one big mushroom plant with a 
        common mind, so although they are one Hero in the game, they define themselves 
        as "we" and therefore we refer to them accordingly.</p>
