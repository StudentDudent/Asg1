                "We are one. We are Legion."
                Concealed in the depth of the Magic Forest,
                the mushroom army kept growing for countless 
                years, until a mysterious threat loomed over 
                the world. 
                <br>The mycelium's collective mind was 
                then forced to reveal itself and join the Guardians of <br>the Dominion, 
                its truly newformed allies.

                Gifted and audacious in equal measure, Iris used to teach rookie 
                sorcerers the art of magic, but her students' unequivocal adoration 
                could never sate her ambitions. In her pursuit of the arcane, she stole 
                the ancient Umbra tome from the Archdemon's private library - only to 
                end up trapped within the book for years to come. Released at last and 
                forever bound to the dark arts, Iris has emerged as a warlock!

                Exiled to faraway worlds, she is overwhelmed by her doubts and 
                knows well the bitterness of loss. Her magic is born of pain, and 
                as the pain grows on and on, so do her powers. How long until she 
                can no longer control them? No one knows.

                the max health of any allies with over 25% of their health currently remaining, then attacks 
                the enemy with the lowest magic defense. The damage dealt depends on the damage dealt to 
                allies and Xe'Sha's magic attack. If the target is killed as a result, allies recover double the 
                health they lost. Xe'Sha's basic attacks deal magic damage and scale with Magic Attack.
