                "We are one. We are Legion."
                Concealed in the depth of the Magic Forest,
                the mushroom army kept growing for countless 
                years, until a mysterious threat loomed over 
                the world. 
                <br>The mycelium's collective mind was 
                then forced to reveal itself and join the Guardians of <br>the Dominion, 
                its truly newformed allies.

                Gifted and audacious in equal measure, Iris used to teach rookie 
                sorcerers the art of magic, but her students' unequivocal adoration 
                could never sate her ambitions. In her pursuit of <br>the arcane, she stole 
                the ancient Umbra tome from the Archdemon's private library - only <br>to 
                end up trapped within the book for years to come. Released at last and 
                forever bound to the dark arts, Iris has emerged as a warlock!
