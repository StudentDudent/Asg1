My website name is Hero Wars Mobile GetToKnow and its about a mobile game, "Hero Wars", that I found through a YouTube advertisement video 2 years ago. The game genres are Casual, MMORPG, Strategy, and Adventure. Everytime I do play it in front of people like my friends or relatives, they do not seem to know about it even though its advertisements pop up quite frequently way before I played the game. So my website is designed to let visitors know more about the game and how its played. I will be covering extra information about the game that may or may not have been covered by the official website and some information that was not covered has already been provided by other similar fanmade sites. The main purpose of the website I created is just an information website.

My design is fairly simple. I took some inspiration in formatting from Overwatch and the official Hero Wars websites. I used screenshots from the mobile app in my phone to provide an understanding of what the gameplay or skills looks like in the game and borders to separate texts so that it is more readable for visitors. I used tahoma and arial fonts as I like how it looks and I was not able to find a more likeable one. Some images and videos from external sources brought more creativity into the characters so I decided to use them as well. I highlighted the play button in top navigation bar so visitors can visit the app store to download the app. 
 
This website is for new visitors or players who would like to know about the mobile game, coming from watching the advertisements or friends. The goal is to spread more awareness about the mobile version of the game that people can play while on the go. My project can help them by letting them know about the game's differences between the pc and mobile versions, and generally, what the game is about.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

Overwatch - https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-gb/ - The formatting and style is what I wanted to go for.
W3Schools - https://www.w3schools.com/howto/default.asp - I used and learned the codes of didfferent features from this website.

JQuery***
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

I decided to go for a trailer becaus I was not able to make the profile pictures responsive. I could not run the back to top button. I decided to also ditch the input of characters as it will make the page very long on mobile.
I had troubles with the logo because it was a little too small as I screenshotted it.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
